              <p>Hello I'm Tommy. I have a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering. I am a self-motivated, analytical and technical minded person.
                My favorite and best subject is mathematics. For the past few years I have worked in a consultant firm as assistant building
                service engineer and in an insurance company as financial planner. And now I am switching my field to information technologies.
                I enjoy self-learning and I am especially interested in trading and latest information technologies.

            <p class="text-white">My dream is to achieve financial freedom and live happily with my dearest. When I don't have to work for money, I can do
              whatever I want, such as travelling to different places in the world, enjoying the pleasure time with my family,
              reading books, watching movies etc. I love to live in a silent place with my wife and do whatever I want without interrupted by
              others.

                <p>I read manga since I was in primary school.
                  I still can recall the memories that I read manga in the library at lunch time at that time.
                  <em>"Doraemon"</em> is the first Japanese manga series I read and the stories was engaging
                  and funny to me. I've been collecting comics since then. I love the way how comic tells
                  the story. Unlike novels and fictions, comic is a combination of graphics and words.
                  It is easier for the reader to image what's actually happening. It is also a new culture
                  and way to tell the stories with greater flexibility. It's hard to find reading a
                  basketball stories with plain texts funny. But I guess everyone born in 80-90's
                  should have heard of <em>"slam dunk"</em>, which is a very famous sports-themed manga series.
                  Nowadays, comics become part of Japanese culture, and manga artists are respected
                  and admired by people of all ages. Manga also gained significant worldwide audience.
                  Manga is a kind of arts to me. I always read a series more than once if I found the stories
                  especially captivating and interesting. Artists have different drawing styles and ways to
                  tell the story. And there are some themes which really inspire me or touch my spirit. Even now,
                  I still read manga in my pastime to release my pressure at work and study.

                    <p class="text-white">I love play all kind of games since I was small, especially computer games. I am especially addicted to
                    the strategic games and card games, such as chess, poker and room escape. It brings me lots of excitement
                    and sense of achievement when I win the game. I also enjoy fps games such as <em>"League Of Legends"</em> and <em>"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds"</em>.
                    Actually the passion for computers started because of games. When I play a game,
                    I'd love to investigate the algorithm and how to optimize it. I am always eager to learn the latest
                    information technologies as well as the applications in our daily lives.</p>

                  <p>I love <em>classical music, jpop and electronic music</em>. Music plays quite an important role in my life.
                    Of all hobbies in the world,I like music most. I enjoy listening to music in everywhere. Especially when
                    I feel stressed or down, I always relax myself by listening to music. I prefer piano songs when I want to
                    focus on study or work. And if I am in a good mood, I'd love to listen to rock music or songs with
                    fast tempo.</p>
                    <p>I always regret for giving up learning musical instruments in my childhood.
                      When I was in primary one , my mom took me to the violin class but I eventually gave up because of difficulties.
                      And I finally determined to learn a musical instrument in my university life. I chose
                      piano because I love how it sounds and it is a great instrument for solo play. The instrument allows you to play both the melody
                      and  the accompaniment at the same time. It is also wide in tonal range and volume, making it easier to play
                      songs in different styles.</p>
                    <p>I practiced quite hard during my university study. I bought a kawai piano and took private piano lessons at
                      my teacher's home. Owing to my persistence to practice hard, my progress is fairly fast. My teacher then encouraged me to take grade 5 ABRSM
                      piano examination after one year of study. I practice even harder at that time and fortunately
                      I obtained a distinction. In fact I felt very stressed and nervous during the examination and my hands sweat
                      all the time. In year 3, my teacher invited me to participate in the X'mas Student Concert and I got 2nd prize
                      in my age group. It was the first time I played the grand piano in front of so many audience, including
                      the students and their parents. I still felt quite stressed, my hands kept sweating and my heart beated very fast.
                      I almost forgot the notes and played by muscle memories. The tempo goes faster than normal speed but it
                      is basically smooth.
                    <p>Time flies like an arrow. My fresh graduate position as an assistant engineer in a building service company drived
                      me very busy and eventually I gave up continuing to play the piano. I wish one day I can pick it up again when
                    I am not that busy. But in the coming few years I may focus more on my career for a better living standard.</p>
